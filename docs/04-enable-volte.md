# Enable VoLTE (and fix calling)

Firstly, you want to install the Mediatek IMS APK, you can do this by opening the PHH Settings (in settings) and > IMS features > Install IMS APK for MediaTek R+ vendor (you will need to be connected to the internet to do this), you will be prompted when it's complete (do not reboot yet)

## Settings to enable in PHH Settings
- IMS features > Request IMS network (on)
- IMS features > Force the presence of 4G Calling setting (on)
- Misc features > Disable "Voice Call In" route (on)
> Not setting this will result in calls being silent.
