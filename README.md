# Duoqin F22 Pro

> Your warranty is now void (maybe). I am not responsible for bricked devices, dead SD cards (not like we had the slot, thanks duoqin), thermonuclear war, or you getting fired because the alarm app failed. Please do some research if you have any concerns about features included in these documents before following them! YOU are choosing to make these modifications, and if you point the finger at me for messing up your device, I will laugh at you. (The docs are also WIP so please do not continue unless you know what you're doing :3)

## Goals

- [x] Dump Original Firmware
- [x] Unlock Bootloader
- [x] Custom Firmware (GSI?)
- [ ] Modules for Device Specific Features
  - [ ] IR Blaster
  - [ ] Keypad Backlight
- [x] VoLTE on Custom Firmware
- [ ] VoWiFi on Custom Firmware
- [ ] Custom Recovery (Not Necessary)
- [x] Magisk

## Current Status

~~I have phone, no fucking clue.~~

Phone is easily unlocked, LineageOS GSI plays pretty well with it, device specific features are still very WIP and I might end up building a custom GSI image for it with these features baked in (w/support for key backlight toggling, etc.)
